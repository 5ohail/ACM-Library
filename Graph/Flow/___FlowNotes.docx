MAX/MIN Closure :  

Closure is a directed subgraph with no outgoing edges. 
MAX/Min Closure means a closure with max/min sum of weighted nodes outside the graph 
For MAX, join source with positive nodes,sink with negative nodes and capacities are absolute value,infinite capacity between existing edges. 
For min,source & sink is reversed.
Ans = sum of positive nodes - min cut (For max)
Ans = sum of negative nodes + min cut (For min)

Minimum Path cover in a Directed Acyclic Graph :

find the minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths to cover each vertex in V.
make a bipartite graph G' = {Vout X Vin , E }
Vout = nodes having positive out-degree
Vin = nodes have positive in-degree
G' has a matching of size m iff there exists n-m vertex-disjoint paths that cover each vertex in G.

Demand Capacity : 

We add a new source s′ and a new sink t′, a new edge from the source s′ to every other vertex, a new edge for every vertex to the sink t′, and one edge from t to s. Additionally we define the new capacity function c′ as:

c′((s′,v))=∑u∈Vd((u,v)) for each edge (s′,v).
c′((v,t′))=∑w∈Vd((v,w)) for each edge (v,t′).
c′((u,v))=c((u,v))−d((u,v)) for each edge (u,v) in the old network.
c′((t,s))=∞
If the new network has a saturating flow (a flow where each edge outgoing from s′ is completely filled, which is equivalent to every edge incoming to t′ is completely filled), then the network with demands has a valid flow, and the actual flow can be easily reconstructed from the new network. Otherwise there doesn't exist a flow that satisfies all conditions.
